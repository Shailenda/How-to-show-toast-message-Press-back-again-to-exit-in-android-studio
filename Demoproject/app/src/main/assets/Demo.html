At present people are busy making weapons to fulfil their treacherous plans as they want absolute control  over things but on the contrary, the poet's mind is fully occupied by that cruel time which has completely transformed his from strong, energetic, high spirited youth into a helpless old. THe poet contrasts his present from teh past and remembers those beauties. But now he is ignored, deserted and lonely.

<p id="t1">14. Write an essay on "Youth and Age".</p>
<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Youth is  energetic and romantic. Youth has a stength to do something. Youth is passionate and guided by his/her own will. A young boy or a girl is lobed by the other. They hae got soft but emotional eyes. When they grow up, they think about  their future and past. One day, they become old and lose their  physical energy. Their past days, effort and achievement become a kind 
of dream to them. They begin to remember their youth and explamentation like the old pensioner in W.B. Yeats' poem.
</br></br>

Though the old man loses physical energy, his soul becomes 
strong and mature. He can think more than the young man. It is said
that to remember the past days for the old man is a habit. Sometimes
the old man bemoans the loss of energy and desire. he fills that his all  desires are still unfulfilled. The great loneliness  and sense of fear
haunts in his memory in old age. With grey hair, wrinkled face the old man
cannot do anYthing except remembering his bygone days sitting by the fire, feeling sleepy and drowsy. 
</br></br>
 It is the rule of nature and time that every young person becomes old. 
Nobody can stop the time and age. As the man becomes older and older so the
reminiscences of his past come into his mind as fresh as before. At
that time, the old man does not have any other way than expressing his grief
and sorrow cursing the time.
